        <p>Earn a Bachelor's Degree
Becoming a video game programmer begins with earning a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering or a related field. Although requirements for these majors differ, most students must complete core courses in mathematics, computer science and data analysis. Students accepted into the major then cover advanced topics, such as using algorithms to create software interfaces. Additionally, programs may mandate that students take lab courses in which they develop their own software or game. Students also typically learn several computer languages, such as C+, C++ and Java. Some programs may allow students to take graphic design and animation courses to supplement their education in programming.</p>
