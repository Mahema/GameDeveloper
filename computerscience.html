The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design is an undergraduate degree program focused on the construction and design of interactive computer games. Reflecting both the growing cultural and economic importance of the computer gaming industry within California and the increasing complexity and specialization of computer gaming systems, the program focuses on the technical, narrative, and artistic underpinnings of these games. The degree features a freshman year introduction to game design, a sophomore year game programming experience, two upper-division digital media electives, and an intensive senior-year game design studio where students work in teams to develop a substantial video game.

This four year interdisciplinary degree program provides a rigorous education in computer science, in concert with a broad introduction to those aspects of art, music, narrative, digital media, and computer engineering most relevant to games. Campus general education requirements ensure that students are exposed to a wide range of topics in the humanities, social sciences, and the arts.

Students wishing to matriculate in this degree program should apply for admission to UC Santa Cruz and the degree program for studies commencing either Freshman year, or Junior year (for transfer students from California community colleges).
